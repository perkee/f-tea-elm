# f-tea-elm
a repo for my friday tech lounge talk about the elm architecture

you should be able to get this going with

```
git checkout https://github.com/perkee/f-tea-elm.git
cd f-tea-elm
yarn install
yarn dev
```
This will run a server in that terminal that hot reloads (but you do sometimes have to refresh, sorry) the app
Then open a new terminal to switch between different commits.
LMK if I missed any packages; everything should be installed and run within the repo.
You definitely want to run `yarn dev` with the latest commit checked out, *then* you can go between historical versions.
